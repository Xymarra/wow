# Xymarra/wow -- Xym UI mods for World of Warcraft.

My main areas of focus are:

*   Saving keystrokes. I have carpal tunnel syndrome, so I will go to extreme lengths to automate tasks that would otherwise require mouse clicks.
*   Simulation. I am a numbers nerd and do physics simulation for robotics in the real world. Simulating game mechanics scratches a very specific itch.
